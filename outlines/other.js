/**
 * Bloom Filter Overview
 *
 * @description A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure used for efficient set membership testing.
 * It offers space efficiency at the cost of allowing a small probability of false positives.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Space-efficient: Uses minimal memory to represent set membership
 * - Probabilistic: Guarantees true negatives, but may have false positives
 * - Based on bit array: Utilizes a bit array and multiple hash functions
 * - Constant-time operations: O(1) for both insertion and membership checking
 * - No element removal: Standard implementation doesn't support removal
 * - Efficiency vs. Accuracy trade-off: Balances memory usage with false positive rate
 *
 * Common applications include caching, network routing, and database systems.

/**
 * Bloom Filter Comparison
 *
 * A Bloom filter is different from graphs or trees:
 *
 * 1. Bloom filter:
 *    - Linear structure (bit array)
 *    - No explicit connections between elements
 *    - Used for set membership tests
 *
 * 2. Graph:
 *    - Nodes connected by edges
 *    - Represents relationships between elements
 *    - Used for network-like problems, pathfinding, etc.
 *
 * 3. Tree:
 *    - Hierarchical structure
 *    - Nodes with parent-child relationships
 *    - Used for hierarchical data, searching, etc.
 *
 * Bloom filters use hash functions, which can be related to certain
 * tree or graph-based structures. However, the Bloom filter itself
 * is fundamentally a flat, linear structure.

/**
 * Hash Function
 *
 * @typedef {Function} Hash
 * @description A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.
 * In the context of hash tables or hash maps, it's used to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Deterministic: The same input always produces the same output
 * - Uniform distribution: Ideally distributes hash values evenly across the output range
 * - Efficiency: Computes quickly for any given input
 * - Avalanche effect: Small changes in input result in significantly different hash values
 *
 * @param {*} key - The input data to be hashed
 * @returns {number} The computed hash value, typically an integer
 *
 * Common uses:
 * - Index generation in hash tables
 * - Data integrity verification
 * - Cryptographic applications (when designed for such purposes)
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * const hash_function = (key) => {
 *   // Simple hash function for demonstration
 *   let hash = 0
 *   for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
 *     hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + key.charCodeAt(i)
 *     hash = hash & hash // Convert to 32-bit integer
 *   }
 *   return Math.abs(hash)
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * @typedef {Object} hash_data_structure_relation
 *
 * @property {Hash} hash_function The hash function used by the hash data structure.
 * @property {Function} index_generation Generates an index from the hash value.
 * @property {Function} collision_resolution Handles cases when multiple keys hash to the same index.
 *
 * @description
 * A hash function is a crucial component of a hash data structure:
 *
 * 1. Key to Index Mapping:
 *    The hash function takes a key as input and produces a hash value.
 *    This hash value is then used to determine the index in the hash's underlying array.
 *
 * 2. Uniform Distribution:
 *    A good hash function aims to distribute keys uniformly across the available indices,
 *    minimizing collisions and ensuring efficient operations.
 *
 * 3. Deterministic Behavior:
 *    The hash function must always produce the same hash value for a given key,
 *    ensuring consistent retrieval of stored values.
 *
 * 4. Collision Handling:
 *    When multiple keys hash to the same index (collision), the hash data structure
 *    uses collision resolution techniques like chaining or open addressing.
 *
 * 5. Performance Impact:
 *    The efficiency of the hash function directly affects the performance of
 *    the hash data structure's operations (insert, get, delete).
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * const my_hash = {
 *   hash_function: (key) => {
 *     // Simple hash function implementation
 *     let hash = 0
 *     for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
 *       hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + key.charCodeAt(i)
 *       hash = hash & hash // Convert to 32-bit integer
 *     }
 *     return Math.abs(hash)
 *   },
 *   index_generation: (hash_value, array_size) => hash_value % array_size,
 *   collision_resolution: (index, key, value, buckets) => {
 *     // Simple chaining implementation
 *     if (!buckets[index]) {
 *       buckets[index] = []
 *     }
 *     buckets[index].push([key, value])
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Hash Data Structure Overview
 *
 * @description A hash (also known as hash table or hash map) is an associative data structure
 * that maps keys to values using a hash function. It provides fast access, insertion, and deletion
 * operations, typically with an average time complexity of O(1).
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * @property {Function} hash_function Converts keys into array indices
 * @property {Array} buckets Stores key-value pairs, often implemented as an array of linked lists
 * @property {number} size Number of key-value pairs in the hash
 * @property {number} capacity Total number of buckets
 *
 * Common operations:
 * @method insert(key, value) Adds a new key-value pair
 * @method get(key) Retrieves the value associated with a key
 * @method delete(key) Removes a key-value pair
 * @method has(key) Checks if a key exists in the hash
 *
 * Performance:
 * - Average case: O(1) for insert, get, delete, and has operations
 * - Worst case: O(n) when many keys hash to the same bucket (collision)
 *
 * @example
 * const my_hash = new Hash()
 * my_hash.insert('name', 'Alice')
 * my_hash.get('name') // Returns 'Alice'
 *
 *
 * Hashes are widely used in various applications, including:
 * - Implementing associative arrays
 * - Database indexing
 * - Caching
 * - And more
 *
 * This widespread use is due to their efficiency in storing and retrieving key-value data.
