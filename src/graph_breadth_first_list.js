   * @description
   * The breadth-first search algorithm is a graph algorithm that traverses the graph level by level.
   * It starts at the source node and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
   *
   * Time Complexity:
   * - O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
   *
   * Space Complexity: O(V) where V is the number of vertices.
