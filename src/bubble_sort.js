  /**
   * @description
   * Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
   * compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   * The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
   *
   * Time Complexity:
   * - Best-case: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
   * - Worst-case: O(n^2) when the array is sorted in reverse order.
   * - Average-case: O(n^2), since the number of comparisons and swaps is proportional to the number of inversions in the array.
