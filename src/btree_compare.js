   * @description
   * This function compares two binary trees to determine if they are identical in both structure and node values.
   * It uses a recursive approach to traverse both trees simultaneously, comparing nodes and their children.
   *
   * Time Complexity:
   * - O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
   *
   * Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
