  /**
   * @description
   * Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays,
   * according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
   *
   * Time Complexity:
   * - Best-case: O(n log n) when the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves.
   * - Worst-case: O(n^2) when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element, causing unbalanced partitions.
   * - Average-case: O(n log n), since the number of comparisons and swaps is proportional to the number of inversions in the array.
