   * @description
   * This function solves a maze using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
   * It explores the maze from the start point to the end point, marking visited cells to avoid redundancy.
   *
   * Time Complexity:
   * - O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (cells) and E is the number of edges (possible moves).
   *
   * Space Complexity: O(V) for the visited set and recursion stack.
