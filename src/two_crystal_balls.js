   * @description
   * This function uses two crystal balls to determine the exact spot in which the ball will break.
   * It works by jumping 2 floors at a time, and if the ball breaks, it will return the index of the floor.
   * If the ball does not break, it will continue to jump 2 floors at a time until it finds the floor where the ball breaks.
   *
   * Time Complexity:
   * - O(sqrt(n)) where n is the number of floors in the building.
