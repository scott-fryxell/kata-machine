   * @description
   * The depth-first search algorithm is a graph algorithm that traverses the graph depth-first.
   * It starts at the source node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   *
   * Time Complexity:
   * - O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
   *
   * Space Complexity: O(V) where V is the number of vertices.
